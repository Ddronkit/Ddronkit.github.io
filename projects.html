                        <br>Linkvan is a mobile application designed for people with low income who
                            have limited access to wifi. The app provides user with locations of basic servies inluding
                            food, shelters, and wifi. It also gives user information about events host by other non-profit dedicated
                            to help with their situation, such as job oppoirtunities if they are looking for employment.

                        <p class = "pj-text"> I got interested in how old games are made, so I followed
                            through a tutorial on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/code-your-first-game/" target="_blank">udemy</a> 
                            and built the basic of this arcade game.<br> I then added
                            keyboard control on top of the mouse control for 2 people to play together, though the left player would be 
                            very annoyed if the right player choose to fiddle aroudn with the mouse in the middle of the match.<br>
                            I've also added a menu screen for aesthetics and the completion of the game. Player can change from single player mode
                            to two-player mode and adjust ball speed or AI tracking speed.

                        <p  class= "pj-text">During a course about software construction, I learned to build an application using Java.
                            So I built a taskmanager starting from having operations in command line then slowly adding features.
                        <br>The end product have pop up screen, some task sorting, quick task addition and themes that will change the entire look
                        and feel of the application.
